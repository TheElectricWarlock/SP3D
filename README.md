SP3D 3D Printer - The Spiciest 3D Printer

The SP3D is a RepRap style 3D printer where most parts are either off the shelf parts or 3D Printed parts. Most of the parts can be 3D printed in a regular 200mm x 200mm printing bed. All electronics are off the shelf electronics, and there is space available in the electronics enclosure for a Raspberry Pi Zero.
